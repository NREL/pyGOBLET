Benchmark Runners
==================

The ``runners`` module provides tools to run optimization algorithms on benchmark problems and log the results. To be tested, all optimization algorithms must be implemented as subclasses of the ``BaseOptimizer`` class. Read more about the base optimizer class on the :mod:`pygold.optimizer` page.
